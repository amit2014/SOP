\section*{Interests: Further investigations in software engineering}
During my time in graduate school, I will focus on expanding my knowledge of software engineering. 
Specifically, I am interested in developing tools to improve developer productivity, such as automated refactorings, bug detection software, and tools to enforce best practices. 
To accomplish this, I will take courses in software engineering, programming languages, and compilers during my graduate education. The undergraduate versions of these courses were the most useful of my education, and these skills proved invaluable in my internships. 

But, developing these tools requires more than just technical skill. 
Creating the proper tool requires a design process guided by empirical findings. Research in software engineering is taking a critical look at how we do things and asking, “Is there a better way?” 
I wrote this statement of purpose in LaTeX and committed my changes to a version control repository. 
The process of creating just a simple text document can be greatly improved through software engineering. 

While at UIUC, I will continue to gain skills from academia and industry and have the best possible preparation for my future career in software engineering.
