\section*{The Future: Attending Columbia}
I am applying to Columbia University because the interests of its faculty closely match my own. 
During my time in graduate school, I will focus on software engineering and programming languages. 
Columbia employs experts in these fields such as Dr. Gail Kaiser and Dr. Jason Nieh. 
These professors lead two impressive research groups, the Programming Systems Laboratory and the Software Systems Laboratory, dedicated to furthering the understanding of software development. 
These groups epitomize my motivation for attending graduate school, learning to develop better software through industry and academic techniques. 
I look forward to continuing my education with world-class faculty and students at Columbia University.
