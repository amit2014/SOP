\section*{The Future: Attending Maryland}
I am applying to the University of Maryland because the interests of its faculty closely match my own. During my time in graduate school, I will focus on software engineering and programming languages. Maryland employs experts in these fields such as Dr. Jeff Foster and Dr. Michael Hicks, whose research in software engineering and programming languages has produced several impressive software analysis tools, such as the FindBugs project. I look forward to learning from these professors and the other world-class faculty and students at the University of Maryland - College Park.
