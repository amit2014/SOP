\section*{The Future: Attending UC San Diego}
I am applying to UC San Diego because the interests of its faculty closely match my own. During my time in graduate school, I will focus on software engineering and programming languages. UC San Diego employs experts in these fields such as Dr. William Griswold and Dr. Ranjit Jhala. These professors lead two impressive research groups, the Software Evolution Group and the Programming Systems Group, dedicated to furthering the understanding of software development and programming languages. These groups epitomize my motivation for attending graduate school, learning to develop better software through industry and academic techniques. I look forward to continuing my education with world-class faculty and students at UC San Diego.
