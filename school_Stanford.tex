\section*{The Future: Attending Stanford}
I am applying to Stanford University because the interests of its faculty closely match my own. During my time in graduate school, I will focus on software engineering and programming languages. Stanford University employs experts in these fields such as Dr. Alex Aiken. In Summer â€˜12, I took an online course on compilers through Coursera taught by Dr. Aiken. Not only was Dr. Aiken a skilled lecturer, he also helped to developed the Cool programming language and DeduceIt application which were used in the assignments. I was fascinated not only by the material in the course, but also by the technologies used to teach it. During my summer internship, I used the knowledge of parsing and abstract syntax trees from this course to build an automated refactoring open source project. I look forward to continuing my education with world-class faculty in person at Stanford University.
