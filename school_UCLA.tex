\section*{The Future: Attending UCLA}
I am applying to UCLA because the interests of its faculty closely match my own. 
During my time in graduate school, I will focus on software engineering and programming languages. 
UCLA employs experts in these fields such as Dr. Todd Millstein and Dr. Jens Palsberg, whose research in software engineering and programming languages has produced several impressive software analysis tools, 
such as the Constraint-Based Program Repair project. 
I look forward to learning from these professors and the other world-class faculty and students at UCLA.
