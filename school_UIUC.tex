\section*{The Future: Attending UIUC}
Since my internship at UIUC, I have been ready to apply to the graduate program. 
After working with professors like Dr. Danny Dig and Dr. Darko Marinov, I know the faculty cares not only about their research, but also the education of their students. 
As we worked to submit our research paper to ICSE, these selfless professors and their students in the software engineering group helped us finish our paper until the 6 a.m. deadline. 
I look forward to returning to Siebel Center and working with the world-class faculty and students again.
