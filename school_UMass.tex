\section*{The Future: Attending UMass}
I am applying to the UMass because the interests of its faculty closely match my own. During my time in graduate school, I will focus on software engineering and programming languages. UMass employs experts in these fields such as Dr. Lori Clarke and Dr. Leon Osterweil. These professors lead the UMass Laboratory for Advanced Software Engineering Research (LASER), a research group dedicated to furthering the understanding of software development. This group epitomizes my motivation for attending graduate school, learning to develop better software through industry and academic techniques. I look forward to continuing my education with world-class faculty and students at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst.
