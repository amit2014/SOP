\section*{The Future: Attending USC}
I am applying to USC because the interests of its faculty closely match my own. During my time in graduate school, my primary focus will be software engineering. USC employs experts in this field such as Dr. Nenad Medvidovic and Dr. Barry Boehm. These professors lead the USC Center for Software Engineering, a research group dedicated to furthering the understanding of software development. This group epitomizes my motivation for attending graduate school, learning to develop better software through industry and academic techniques. I look forward to continuing my education with world-class faculty and students at USC.
